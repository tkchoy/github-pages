#solidarity


solidarity not with one another, but with snails

how history of struggles; shaped by the species. Shaped by specific evolution, life histories, etc. 

### Multispecies solidarities -- 

#multispecies

Makua Valley

uncle sparky - 

makua helped us

culture
also toxics
also snails

###  MALAMA MAKUA


malama  - coalition
challenge army activities in the valley; sierra club defense fund; earth justice. NEPRA
EIS

"genuine" and "strategic" - concern for snails; and points of leverage. We can't defend us, but we can defend endangered species.  -- But this has always been the case for indicator and keystone species. 

solidarities -- is it inherent, endemic to, the ESA -- is it about species; a product of the structure of law; the relation formed between land policy and environmental policy, between land and 

### SOLIDARITIES -- 

solidarity - substance: 

> KINSHIP: diffuse and enduring solidarity and substances of kinship

**Bubbles of Exclosure**

IS THE PRESENCE OF THE OTHER.  MNIMAL NOTION OF AGENCY. 

Cooperation and mutualism. 
Organisms; and species. minimal agency. 

#  My thoughts: 
- solidarity as being related to the idea of INTEREST and STAKE.  not necessarily mutual benefit. 

- not about USE. beings with interests.  solidarity is empty

- interests and allies; ANT; (and the flag you put in there about not wanting to flatten). 

- so what about accomplices vs allies. SOLIDARITIES - political work; how, for instance, do people theorize solidarity; togetherness.  COMPLICITY. 

- solidarity - workers of the world; "interest" "class position" what is the relation between "interest" and subjectification.  

- SOLIDARITY - so is this a theorization of solidarity where the form of solidarity is itself conditioned by, immanent to, the landscape of law and conservationist and biological apprehensions of evolutionary life.   lives as species and geographically conditioned endemisms / species difference/differentiation?  

population; reproduction

distribution. genetic variability; conservation to maintain genetic diversity - NICE.  8 evolutionarily significant UNITS.  DIRECTION. Conservation requires 10 fenced enclosure areas. 

## LOGIC OF RECOGNITION

the other snails - 
EXCLOSURE --> 

**Bubbles of Safety**

Conservation approach - conservation of particular forests. 

solidarity with others

allyship

## my questions

is this solidarity theorized via allyship; via co-subjection; 


what is the work of calling it solidarity?
what is the theorization of togetherness in solidarity
- shared interest?
- shared condition?
- differential 


solidarity - workers of the world
	- species of the world
	- elemental affinity (substance)
	- 



Is `solidarity` something 

The interessement process is a function of ESA; conservation policy, and the speciesisms. of the politics of keystone species. (the logic of recognition) 


i think of solidarity as a vocative: an aspirational enacting.
	- who is the addressee - and what is the nature of the call? 
	- 


solidarity - alliance

1. accomplices not ally 


by the way, i appreciate the commitment to an unspecified sense of solidarity;
or the sense that there is a pluripotential for the very form that multispecies solidarities might take in situated, historical conjunctures/ coalescences. the paper is so good at teaching us to discern the form and conditioning of something like "keystone solidarities"
